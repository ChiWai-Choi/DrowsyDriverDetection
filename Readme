Steps to run the driver drowsiness detection project (CSE 547 Discrete Mathematics):

1) Run the run_extract_eyes.sh program to track the eyes for different videos(training data) and to store the patches of the eyes in a folder for every video. (Alert and Drowsy)
2) Use this training data to retrain the CNN model(Inception V3 model).
3) Run extract_features.py to extract the features from the second last layer of the CNN model which is a 2048-d vector and to create a sequence of frames as a single vector to be given as an input to the LSTM which is a part of Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN) 
4) Run data.py and models.py
5) Finally run train.py to get the final predictions for the test sequence of data and the alarm will sound if the model predicts the sequence to be in a drowsy state.
